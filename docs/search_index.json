Love, Ph.D. Version: 2019-07-19 15:21:12 Introduction These Notes provide a series of examples using R to work through issues that are likely to come up in PQHS/CRSP/MPHP 431. While these Notes share some of the features of a textbook, they are neither comprehensive nor completely original. The main purpose is to give 431 students a set of common materials on which to draw during the course. In class, we will sometimes: reiterate points made in this document, amplify what is here, simplify the presentation of things done here, use new examples to show some of the same techniques, refer to issues not mentioned in this document, but what we don’t do is follow these notes very precisely. We assume instead that you will read the materials and try to learn from them, just as you will attend classes and try to learn from them. We welcome feedback of all kinds on this document or anything else. Just email us at 431-help at case dot edu, or submit a pull request. What you will mostly find are brief explanations of a key idea or summary, accompanied (most of the time) by R code and a demonstration of the results of applying that code. Everything you see here is available to you as HTML or PDF. You will also have access to the R Markdown files, which contain the code which generates everything in the document, including all of the R results. We will demonstrate the use of R Markdown (this document is generated with the additional help of an R package called bookdown) and R Studio (the “program” which we use to interface with the R language) in class. All data and R code related to these notes are available through the course website. Structure The Notes, like the 431 course, fall in three main parts. Part A is about visualizing data and exploratory data analyses. These Notes focus on using R to work through issues that arise in the process of exploring data, managing (cleaning and manipulating) data into a tidy format to facilitate useful work downstream, and describing those data effectively with visualizations, numerical summaries, and some simple models. Part B is about making comparisons with data. The Notes discuss the use of R to address comparisons of means and of rates/proportions, primarily. The main ideas include confidence intervals, using the bootstrap and making decisions about power and sample size. We’ll also discuss the value (or lack thereof) of p values for assessing hypotheses. Key ideas from Part A that have an impact here include visualizations to check the assumptions behind our inferences, and cleaning/manipulating data to facilitate our comparisons. Part C is about building models with data. The Notes are primarily concerned (in 431) with linear regression models for continuous quantitative outcomes, using one or more predictors. We’ll see how to use models to accomplish many of the comparisons discussed in Part B, and make heavy use of visualization and data management tools developed in Part A to assess our models. Course Philosophy In developing this course, we adopt a modern approach that places data at the center of our work. Our goal is to teach you how to do truly reproducible research with modern tools. We want you to be able to answer real questions using data and equip you with the tools you need in order to answer those questions well (Çetinkaya-Rundel (2017) has more on a related teaching philosophy.) The curriculum includes more on several topics than you might expect from a standard graduate introduction to statistics. data gathering data wrangling exploratory data analysis and visualization multivariate modeling communication It also nearly completely avoids formalism and is extremely applied - this is most definitely not a course in theoretical or mathematical statistics. The 431 course is about getting things done. It’s not a statistics course, nor is it a computer science course. It is instead a course in data science.

["data-science.html", "Chapter 1 Data Science 1.1 Why a unicorn? 1.2 Data Science Project Cycle 1.3 What Will We Discuss in 431?", " Chapter 1 Data Science The definition of data science can be a little slippery. One current view of data science, is exemplified by Steven Geringer’s 2014 Venn diagram. Figure 1.1: Data Science Venn Diagram from Steven Geringer The field encompasses ideas from mathematics and statistics and from computer science, but with a heavy reliance on subject-matter knowledge. In our case, this includes clinical, health-related, medical or biological knowledge. As Gelman and Nolan (2017) suggest, the experience and intuition necessary for good statistical practice are hard to obtain, and teaching data science provides an excellent opportunity to reinforce statistical thinking skills across the full cycle of a data analysis project. The principal form in which computer science (coding/programming) play a role in this course is to provide a form of communication. You’ll need to learn how to express your ideas not just orally and in writing, but also through your code. 1.1 Why a unicorn? Data Science is a team activity. Everyone working in data science brings some part of the necessary skillset, but no one person can cover all three areas alone for excellent projects. [The individual who is truly expert in all three key areas (mathematics/statistics, computer science and subject-matter knowledge) is] a mythical beast with magical powers who’s rumored to exist but is never actually seen in the wild. http://www.kdnuggets.com/2016/10/battle-data-science-venn-diagrams.html 1.2 Data Science Project Cycle A typical data science project can be modeled as follows, which comes from the introduction to the amazing book R for Data Science, by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham, which is a key text for this course (Grolemund and Wickham 2019). Figure 1.2: Source: R for Data Science: Introduction This diagram is sometimes referred to as the Krebs Cycle of Data Science. For more on the steps of a data science project, we encourage you to read the Introduction of Grolemund and Wickham (2019). 1.3 What Will We Discuss in 431? We’ll discuss each of these elements in the 431 course, focusing at the start on understanding our data through transformation, modeling and (especially in the early stages) visualization. In 431, we learn how to get things done. We get people working with R and R Studio and R Markdown, even if they are completely new to coding. A gentle introduction is provided at Ismay and Kim (2019) We learn how to use the tidyverse (http://www.tidyverse.org/), an array of tools in R (mostly developed by Hadley Wickham and his colleagues at R Studio) which share an underlying philosophy to make data science faster, easier, more reproducible and more fun. A critical text for understanding the tidyverse is Grolemund and Wickham (2019). Tidyverse tools facilitate: importing data into R, which can be the source of intense pain for some things, but is really quite easy 95% of the time with the right tool. tidying data, that is, storing it in a format that includes one row per observation and one column per variable. This is harder, and more important, than you might think. transforming data, perhaps by identifying specific subgroups of interest, creating new variables based on existing ones, or calculating summaries. visualizing data to generate actual knowledge and identify questions about the data - this is an area where R really shines, and we’ll start with it in class. modeling data, taking the approach that modeling is complementary to visualization, and allows us to answer questions that visualization helps us identify. and last, but definitely not least, communicating results, models and visualizations to others, in a way that is reproducible and effective. Some programming/coding is an inevitable requirement to accomplish all of these aims. If you are leery of coding, you’ll need to get past that, with the help of this course and our stellar teaching assistants. Getting started is always the most challenging part, but our experience is that most of the pain of developing these new skills evaporates by early October. Having completed some fundamental work in Part A of the course, we then learn how to use a variety of R packages and statistical methods to accomplish specific inferential tasks (in Part B, mostly) and modeling tasks (in Part C, mostly.)
